### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2016

+ Projec title: Fun Facts of Inauguration Speeches
+ This project is conducted by Vanessa Huang,yh2873

+ Project summary: In this project, I tried to find some fun facts of inaugurations speeches. For example: 


+ 1. the lengths of the sentences in inauguration speeches are getting shorter. Presidents tend to use simple words and simple sentences to make sure everyone can understaned their speeches.

+ 2. Republicans are more "wordy" than the Democrats.
