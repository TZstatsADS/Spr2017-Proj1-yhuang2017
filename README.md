### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2016

+ Projec title: Fun Facts of Inauguration Speeches
+ This project is conducted by Vanessa Huang,yh2873

+ Project summary: In this project, I tried to find some fun facts of inaugurations speeches. For example: 1.the lengths of the sentences in inauguration speeches are getting shorter. Presidents tend to use simple words and simple sentences to make sure everyone can understaned their speeches. 2. Republicans is more "wordy" than the Democrats. 3.President Woodrow Wilson is the "greatest" president since he used more than 1 "great" among 120 words.
